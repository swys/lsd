# lsd
## 

Streaming list of directory contents.
Give lsd a directory and it will spit out the contents of that directory.
lsd is a transform stream so you can either pipe data into it or hook into its output and consume a directories contents.

lsd is a super simple tool that has no features. In fact, having no features is its main feature!
