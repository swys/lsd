  "description": "wait what? this isn't that type of program. Streaming ls like module. Write a path into lsd and get back a stream of that directories contents. You will get back a stream of full paths. You can easily hookup a filtering transform stream to alter the output to fit your needs (i.e. strip the paths if you don't need them). Initialize lsd with depth option and then write a path to lsd and get back a stream of the directories contents DEPTH levels deep. Pass 0 to depth option and get back the entire directory tree.",
